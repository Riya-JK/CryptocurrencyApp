The Cyrpto Currency App is a mobile application designed for Android devices, offering users real-time access to updated market data within the crypto world, including coin prices, volumes, market caps, all-time highs (ATHs), return rates, and more. This application was meticulously developed using the clean architecture approach, following the MVVM pattern. Its user interface (UI) is powered by Jetpack Compose, complemented by the Material3 theme for a sleek appearance. Additionally, Dagger dependency injection, facilitated by the Android library Hilt, has been seamlessly integrated. The app retrieves its data through Retrofit, a HTTP library, sourcing information from the free and open-source API: https://api.coinpaprika.com/.
